<p class="intro">
A parallel universe is a hypothetical self-contained plane of existence, co-existing with one's own.The sum of all potential parallel universes that constitute reality is often called a â€œmultiverse". While the three terms are generally synonymous and can be used interchangeably in most cases, there is sometimes an additional connotation implied with the term "alternate universe/reality" that implies that the reality is a variant of our own, with some overlap with the similarly-named alternate history.

	<th colspan="2">CONCEPTS RELATED TO PARALLEL UNIVERSES</th>
	<tr>
		<td>Hyperspace</td>
		<td> Perhaps the most common use of the concept of a parallel universe in science fiction is the concept of hyperspace. Used in science fiction, the concept of "hyperspace" often refers to a parallel universe that can be used as a faster-than-light shortcut for interstellar travel.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Counter - Earth</td>
		<td>The concept of Counter-Earth might seem similar to a parallel universe, but is actually a distinct idea. A counter-earth is a planet that shares Earth's orbit but is on opposition, therefore, cannot be seen from Earth. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Time travel and alternate history</td>
		<td>Technically, alternative histories as a result of time travel are not parallel universes: while multiple parallel universes can co-exist simultaneously, only one history or alternative history can exist at any one moment, as alternative history usually involves, in essence, overriding the original timeline with a new one.</td>
